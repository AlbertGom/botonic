# **Guided Flow**

[View on Github](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/tree/master/templates/childs)

This template shows how to build a bot with deep flows, where users navigate a decision tree using interactive elements like buttons. This is useful when you want to guide the user through a conversation with predefined flows that consist of several steps. Examples of this type of bots include (but are not limited to):

* Surveys
* Pre-qulify leads before human handoff
* On-boarding processes
* FAQs (when you have a very limited set of options)

In the same way you build a website with a deep tree of routes, in botonic you make use of `childRoutes` to describe actions that are only accessible if the user is in the parent route.

With the following example we will see better how `childRoutes` work:

```javascript
import Hi from './actions/hi'
import Pizza from './actions/pizza'
import Sausage from './actions/sausage'
import Bacon from './actions/bacon'
import Pasta from './actions/pasta'
import Cheese from './actions/cheese'
import Tomatosap from './actions/tomato'

export const routes: [
    {path: 'hi', text: /^hi$/i, action: Hi,
        childRoutes: [
            {path: 'pizza', text: /^pizza$/i, action: Pizza, 
                childRoutes: [
                    {path: 'sausage', text: /^sausage$/i, action: Sausage},
                    {path: 'bacon', text: /^bacon$/i, action: Bacon}
                ]
            },
            {path: 'pasta', text: /^pasta$/i, action: Pasta, 
                childRoutes: [
                    {path: 'cheese', text: /^cheese$/i, action: Cheese},
                    {path: 'tomato', text: /^tomato$/i, action: Tomato}
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
]
```

When the user starts the conversation the bot will ask whether he wants to eat pizza or pasta. You "force" the user to select either one by prompting two quick replies:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text, Reply } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return (
        <Text>
            Hi! Choose what you want to eat:
            <Reply payload='pizza'>Pizza</Reply>
            <Reply payload='pasta'>Pasta</Reply>
        </Text>
    )
  }
}
```

We have the option of pizza and also pasta. This is where `childRoutes` comes in. Depending on our choice, chatbot will ask us different things. When choosing pizza, chatbot asks us if we want sausage or bacon as an ingredient, while with pasta chatbot will ask us if we want cheese or tomato. On the other hand, if you try to access the components of the ingredients directly you will not find them, since the path to access is `hi -> pizza / pasta -> ingredient`. This way, it is guaranteed that only if you have chosen the food first in this example, then can you choose the ingredient.

## Alternatives

In certain cases, it could be preferable to mantain your routes' file as clean as possible. Let's take the previous example and replace the text attributes with payloads.

**src/routes.js**

```javascript
import { routes as hiRoutes } from './actions/hiFlow/hi.routes'
import Hi from './actions/hi'

export const routes: [
    {path: 'hi', payload: /^hi$/i, action: Hi, childRoutes: hiRoutes}
] 
```

**src/actions/hiFlow/hi.routes.js**

```javascript
import Pizza from './actions/hiFlow/Pizza'
import Sausage from './actions/hiFlow/Sausage'
import Bacon from './actions/hiFlow/Bacon'
import Pasta from './actions/hiFlow/Pasta'
import Cheese from './actions/hiFlow/Cheese'
import Tomato from './actions/hiFlow/Tomato'

export const routes: [
  {path: 'pizza', action: Pizza}
  {path: 'sausage', action: Sausage},
  {path: 'bacon', action: Bacon},
  {path: 'pasta', action: Pasta},
  {path: 'cheese', action: Cheese},
  {path: 'tomato', action: Tomato}
]

```

You can achieve the same flow's behaviour by preserving the parent of the previous flow and doing the following modifications in the corresponding action files:

Note that you can specify directly what action has to be triggered when answering to a reply with the attribute `path="childStateURL"`. 


```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text, Reply } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return (
        <Text>
            Hi! Choose what you want to eat:
            <Reply path='pizza'>Pizza</Reply>
            <Reply path='pasta'>Pasta</Reply>
        </Text>
    )
  }
}
```

So after applying this operation to each action file you will have the ability to obtain the desired flow.

### Working with URL Parameters

Since every action is linked in the same way as URL's do, you can also pass additional parameters to them in order to have a better control of your responses. So, the following piece of code will fill our params object:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text, Action } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return (
        <Text>
            What's your favourite flavour?
            <Reply path='pizza?ans=spicy'>Spicy</Reply>
            <Reply path='pizza?ans=salty'>Salty</Reply>
        </Text>
    )
  }
}
```

Then you can access its parameters in the following way in `src/actions/hiFlow/pizza.js`:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {

  render() {
    if(this.params.ans == 'spicy'){
      return (
          <Text>
              Be sure you have the air conditioner turned on.
          </Text>
      )     
    } else if (this.params.ans == 'salty'){
      return(
          <Text>
              Be sure you have a bottle of water near.
          </Text>
      )
    } else{
      return(
          <Text>
              This option is not available.
          </Text>
      )
    }
  }
}
```

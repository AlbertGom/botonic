# **How to use Botonic Plugins?**

In order to use one of the [available](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic/tree/master/packages) Botonic plugins, 
you will need to:
* Add a `plugins.js` file in your Botonic project at the root of **src**.
* Require every plugin you want to be executed every time the input is processed.
* Import your plugins in **src/app.js** and pass them to the App.

```javascript
import { App } from '@botonic/react'

import { routes } from './routes'
import { locales } from './locales'
import { plugins } from './plugins'

export default new App({ routes, locales, plugins })
```


** src/plugins.js **  

```javascript
export const plugins = [
  {
    id: 'dialogflow',
    resolve: require('botonic-plugin-dialogflow'),
    options: {
      token: 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
    }
  }
]
```

After this is done, you will have your plugins running!  
## ** Accessing plugins within your Actions **
If for any scenario you need to access the plugin within your bot actions, you can also access and run them by the `id` you have defined when requiring your plugins, as shown in the example:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'
import { RequestContext } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static contextType = RequestContext

  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath, plugins }) {
    let { dialogflow } = plugins
    await dialogflow.pre({ input, session, lastRoutePath })
    // Your stuff
  }

  render() {
      // Your rendered components
  }
```

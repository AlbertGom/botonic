# **Botonic Settings**

## NLU Integrations
Integrate your bots with your preferred NLU services. For further information see the [NLU section](/main-concepts/nlu).

## Botonic Options

`options.js` is the main file where you can define all your Botonic options. For now, these are the additional options you can set:

```javascript
export const options = {
    typingOptions: { 
        delay: 1,
        typing: 2 
    }
}
```

In `typingOptions` you can define the expected behaviours of your bot when sending messages.
  * `delay`: Specifies the seconds that pass before sending the order to process the user input.
  * `typing`: Specifies how much seconds the typing component has to be displayed.

Both options are set to 0 by default. Feel free tuninng these parameters to obtain the expected behaviour of your bot.
  
If necessary, you can also define these settings inside your messages. In this case, the values defined inside a message will have preference over the default settings of `botonic.config.js`.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'

export default class extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return (
        <>
            <Text delay='2'>
                Hi!
            </Text>
            <Text typing='1'>
                How are you?
            </Text>
            <Text delay='1' typing='1'>
                I am very glad to see you again.
            </Text>
        </>
    )
  }
}
```

# **Human Handoff**

As bots aren’t perfects, we allow to transfer a conversation into an agent.

To configure transfer the conversation into an agent, you must provide the `session` parameters and then the `queue_name` and `next_action`, which are optional, but recommended.

The `queue_name` is the name of the queue where you want to transfer the conversation. If a queue with that name doesn't exist, it will transfer the chat into a random open queue.

The `next_action` allows you to specify which is going to be the next action that the bot will follow after the conversation with the agent has finished.

Here’s a simple example of how to transfer the conversation into the queue 'Support_Queue' and the next step of the bot will be an action called 'say_goodbye'.

> #### NOTE:
> Right now the conversation is going to be transfer into Hubtype Desk, so the `queue_name` must be the name of a queue inside Hubtype Desk, but in the future it will be posible to transfer the chat into Zendesk, Front or another ticketing tools.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'
import { humanHandOff } from '@botonic/core'

export default class extends React.Component {

  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    await humanHandOff(session, 'Support_Queue', {action: 'say_goodbye'})
  }

  render() {
    return(
      <Text>
        Thanks for contacting us! One of our agents will take the conversation
        as soon as posible.
      </Text>
    )
  }
}
```

## Open Queues

You can get an array of all the open queues of your Hubtype Desk just with this simple Botonic function: `getOpenQueues()`.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from '@botonic/react'
import { getOpenQueues } from '@botonic/core'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static async botonicInit({ input, session, params, lastRoutePath }) {
    let openQueues = await getOpenQueues(session)
    return { openQueues }
  }

  render() {
    if(!this.props.openQueues.queues.length) {
      return (
        <Text>There are no open queues</Text>
      )
    } else {
      return(
        <Text>Open queues: {this.props.openQueues.queues.join(',')}</Text>
      )
    }
  }
}

```
